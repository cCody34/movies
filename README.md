# TV Search Front End Project

## Description

Since completing the Northcoders bootcamp, I have begun working on this TV Search Front End Project.

For this project I am creating a front end for the TV Maze API, which can be found at: https://www.tvmaze.com/api

Please note this project is still a work in progress, with limited functionality and styling currently.

## Other front end projects

### NC News

For a more mature front end project, please take a look at my social news site, nc news.

The deployed version of this can be found here: https://nc-news-ccody34.netlify.app/

The repository for nc news can be found here: https://github.com/cCody34/fe-nc-news

### NC Anagrams

I have also completed a group project with 4 other developers, which is a multi-player anagram game.

The hosted version of this game can be found at: https://nc-anagrams.netlify.app/
