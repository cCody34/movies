# TV Search Front End Project

Since completing the Northcoders bootcamp, I have begun working on this TV Search Front End Project.

For this project I am creating a front end for the TV Maze API, which can be found at: https://www.tvmaze.com/api

Please note this project is still a work in progress, with limited functionality and styling currently.
